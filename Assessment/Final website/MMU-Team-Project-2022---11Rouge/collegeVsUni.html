                <p>
                    One of the most intimidating things international students face far from their home is their confusion about a
                    foreign education system, its organization, and its unique vocabulary. For a unique education system like the
                    one in the UK such confusions are highly pronounced. The University in UK is a recognized educational
                    organization which has the legal right of issuing higher education degrees.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Typically, study programs at UK universities lead to the following degrees:</p>
                <p> • Undergraduate degrees</p>
                <p> • Postggraduate degrees</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Some universities in UK run colleges which offer further education courses like foundation degrees to prepare
                    students to enter the regular university degree.
                </p>

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>
                    College, in contrast to university, is an educational institution that offers further education courses leading
                    to specific degrees or qualifications. If you would say to someone “I’m a college student in UK” they would
                    guess that you’re learning to get your A-Levels or BTEC’s to enter university afterward.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>College qualifications in UK include the followings:</p>
                <p> • Diploma</p>
                <p> • Foundation Degrees</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    College courses in UK are designed to teach students to reach a certain level of skills and knowledge in a
                    particular field of interest which makes them able to get a job or gain academic preparation to enter
                    university.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to the university which tends to be equally focused in practice and theory, college courses in UK
                    pay more attention to provide you with more practical skills. That is mainly because most students in UK choose
                    the college to become employable in a short time. Usually, a further education course in college lasts for one
                    to two years of full-time studies. During this time, you spend most of the time being taught how to apply your
                    skills in a real environment. If you already have a job or for other similar reasons you have limited time,
                    colleges in UK offer various flexible study programs and part-time studies.
