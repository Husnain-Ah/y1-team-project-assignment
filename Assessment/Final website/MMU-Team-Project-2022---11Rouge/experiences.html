                    As someone who has moved out of their hometown, my university experience will be different from others who commute to MMU. When you move out, you realize that you have more responsibility than you did when you were at home, because you have to do everything
                    such as cook and clean however it did sound bad at first however you learn how to adapt to it, and it ensures you become more mature by the time you finish university. By deciding to move out, I got to meet amazing people from all
                    around the world that have ended up becoming my friends. On the other hand, there are some negatives when it comes to moving out, such as managing your time and budgeting your money; however, doing this daily is an important skill
                    you would need to learn eventually. The people you meet are the people who make up your university experience so it is important to try to make friends where you can be yourself. If you do move out, the first week can get lonely however
                    you will eventually meet the right people at the right time so don’t stress about being alone. Overall, my university experience is very good because of the people I have around me and I can say that it was a very good decision I have
                    made in life.
                </p>

                <h2>Husnain Ahmed</h2>
                <p>My experience at MMU has been overall very pleasant, the work while more than I was used to wasn’t too stressful. Living at home with my parents has allowed me to both save money and manage my time as I do not have to pay rent. I have
                    taken up more responsibility at home by cooking for my family more among other things. The largest change for me is waking up an hour and a half earlier than my lessons so that I could commute via the train. This is rather annoying
                    when it comes to lectures or labs that start at 9 am as I have to get up early and the trains are very congested as that is a time that many people have to commute to work or education. This is quite unpleasant as there is often no
                    place to sit down and people are often struggling to even find space to stand. So overall, while I think that going to university is harder than college due to the added responsibility and need to manage your time to commute, it is
                    not too big of a jump especially if you used a bus to commute to college.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My experience in MMU has been a lot different to what I expected, everyone used to tell me university is going to be the best years of your life; however, I don’t really see how although we have come during the pandemic and the friends I’ve made in university
                    are actually vibes so I can see what they mean. Especially when we are all working on projects its fun as we all have a little mess about but its fun creating something with good people. In terms of the work I feel it varies and also
                    depends on the teachers and lecturers some explain well and some not so well which requires a bit more of your own research and attempts at the work, luckily Moodle we have for out assignments more or less has everything we need to
                    know for each assignment which is a massive help for when your doing the work and trying to research about, as talking to the teachers and lecturers isn’t always a comfortable thing for a lot of people. So overall I have enjoyed university
                    so far.

                <p>
                    Moving to Manchester for university was scary at first, as it was my first time moving out, and I was now fully independent and living over an hour away from home. I booked a university accomodation that wasn't officially linked to MMU so I didn't know
                    if anyone would be staying there who also went to MMU however almost every single person at my accomodation goes to MMU. However on the first day of moving in I immediately made friends with people from my accomodation and on my first
                    day of university at the orientation/introduction events I made friends on my course. I realised that I was nervous, but so was everybody else because it is the first time for everyone. The accommodation I am staying at is very nice
                    quality, and the atmosphere of the city is very nice. Public transport in the city is great, with busses, trams, and trains, making the commute from my accommodation to the MMU buildings for lectures and classes both cheap and easy.
                    The online systems MMU provides like Moodle allow me to organise my time efficiently and stay on top of work, even if I have to take time off. The university also provides access to thousands of books, articles, and papers in the library,
                    in addition to computers with access to several paid software packages like office and adobe, enabling me to be productive and easily collaborate with other students.

                <h2>Aburahman Said</h2>
                <p>
                    My experience in the first year of doing software engineering was mixed at times it was difficult and frustrating, but also could be fun and enjoyable. As I believe the university has a good environment in which other students would constantly try to
                    assist you if you are struggling with something. Teachers are always available online and on campus to support you and give the assistance you need. Having access to all the lecture and class materials made my experience with the first
                    year a lot easier I can find all need using Moodle. However, the tough part for me is that I struggled at first to find friends to talk to at university, but as time goes, I meet and talk with new people since group projects enabled
                    me to make friends and develop my communication skills. Managing my time was difficult at the beginning of my course since I didn't understand how the university's system worked and there was a lot of destruction outside of university
                    that diverted me from finishing my work, such as having a job. Also, I find it extremely difficult at times to find anything that motivates me to complete my work and assignments, which can be extremely difficult at times, since I
                    live with my family, they constantly encourage me and push me to do the work, which has helped me to be more motivated.

                <h2>Shah Rahman</h2>
                <p>
                    Through the start of the academic year- I was a little nervous about going to Uni and making that gigantic leap from College, for obvious reasons such as the level of work needed for a degree, the extra hours of studying, meeting new people and adjusting
                    to the new scenery around me in order to get by. Commuting to University has been my worst issue in that I usually get ready 1 hour and 30 minutes before lesson to get there and as my colleague Husnain A. mentions there is usually
                    no space to sit on the tram or train when commuting to University and to top it off the timing of lessons especially when your particular day starts on a 9 am start. But the things that I’ve found fun in University have been the fact
                    that due to being a city based University everything is around the University be it apartments and entertainment spots as well as commercial stores due to the fact that many students are international or live near the campus- There
                    are plenty of activities and enjoyment to partake in especially with friends thus making my University experience very nice.
                </p>

                <h2>Husnain Iqbal</h2>
                <p>
                    So far, I have enjoyed my first year of software engineering at MMU. The staff and students are very friendly and approachable. The course and its content are providing me with useful and relevant knowledge that will allow me to succeed in the industry
                    after graduation and as a person in my own personal growth. During my first year I have found it particularly useful that the teaching staff at MMU, from lecturers and lab tutors, are always open to answering questions and giving support
                    in lectures, labs and in their own time via emails or teams calls. This level of support from the MMU teaching staff has helped me to achieve good grades and push myself even more in each of this year’s Modules. Outside of lectures
                    and labs I have joined different societies to meet more people in the university. This year I joined the university ISOC (Islamic society) and the PAKSOC (Pakistani society) and attended events for each society. At these events I have
                    met like-minded people from across the university studying different subjects and made new friends.

                <h2>Kyle Kadlec</h2>
                <p>
                    My experience so far at MMU has been a great one. This is due to a combination of the staff, peers and the facilities available. Primarily, the staff have all been extremely welcoming and respectful to everyone around me including myself, creating a comfortable
                    atmosphere to work in which makes it easy to ask questions and express thoughts. My peers have also been a huge factor in settling in so easily because everyone in my course is like-minded; all having similar interests and hobbies,
                    making it easy to speak and develop friendships with anyone. Finally, the facilities that the University has to offer are second-to-none. Ranging from huge libraries to countless study/computer rooms, everything that is needed for
                    a successful University experience is available at MMU, making it a fantastic experience to endure.

                <p>
                    Afnan is an electrical and electronic engineering student, and she enjoyed her time at Manchester Metropolitan University because they offer a variety of assistance options. She liked the idea that if you need help with your work, there are professionals
                    available to help you, as well as classes to help you develop academic writing skills. However, in recent years, campus has been inaccessible due to covid, and she has had to complete the course online as a full-time student, making
                    her course and experience overall more difficult.

                <h2>Jake – Business Management 6 Feb 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    Jake has had an enjoyable experience at Manchester Metropolitan University. It aided him to learn a lot about his course as believed the information and subject were highly useful and made him learn and develop his skills within his course. It also taught
                    him a lot about himself duo to the fact that he lived alone and began meeting and working in teams with different people, which pushed him to form relationships with people.

                <h2>Harry – Product Design Engineering 6 Feb 20</h2>
                <p>
                    Harry described his experience as comfortable since the support was easy to obtain and incredibly quick and efficient because the lecturers were constantly accessible to assist and provide feedback. As there’s a lot of the sports societies have really
                    relaxed open sessions that feel comfortable for anyone to attend as well as the opportunity to compete in competitions for the universities teams. There is also a huge variety of non-sport society’s, literally something for everyone!
                    Some of which are things you will have never even heard of. As The union is run by students with a genuine passion to improve student life. They are always on hand to help with information. However, University can be frustrating at
                    time for him but ultimately, he feels extremely rewarded by his progress within his course and as a person

                <p>
                    My overall experience has it's ups and downs, beginning with tutors leaving the course without notice. I really struggled without a laptop at the beginning but now I have one. I had some issues regarding student finance but now resolved. The positive
                    part of my experience is I have had tutors that were supportive giving useful advice that truly helped me and of course my classmates as I was able to communicate and contact them when I needed help with assignments and classmates
                    that I could trust.

                <h2>Alexandros – LAW LLB(Hons) – MAY 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    An outstanding University with a large campus situated in one of the best student cities in Europe. The infrastructure is excellent and currently there are world-leading facilities under construction which will open in 2021 and 2022. The course is well
                    structured, has great material and is run by experts who care about your personal growth. The stuff as well as the lecturers are very friendly and supportive. Manchester Metropolitan University is an ambitious University committed
                    to lead in education and innovation.

                <h2>Sayed – LAW LLB (Hons) MAY 2016</h2>
                <p>
                    I studied Bachelor of Laws at MMU and graduated in 2016. During my three years at MMU, I have been involved with various volunteering projects. University teachers and staffs were very helpful. I enjoyed living in halls in my second year. I think every
                    new student should explore opportunities while at uni. I have been involved with Student Ambassador and Peer Mentoring scheme. I was also nominated International Student of the Year (Business and Law) in 2013-14 session. This helped
                    my career prospects in Bangladesh.
                </p>

                <h2>Misbah – Accounting and Finance BSc (Hons) MAY 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s been a good experience so far but some of the teaching can be better and less rushed as its hard to understand concepts right away. Attendance seems to be a big problem as sometimes lectures and tutorial can be less than half empty and you hardly
                    see friends and classmates. The library is really good as there’s group and silent areas.
