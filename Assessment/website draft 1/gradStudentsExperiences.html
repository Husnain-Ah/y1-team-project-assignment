    <h2>Afnan – Electric and Electronic Engineering 20 May2021</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Afnan is an electrical and electronic engineering student, and she enjoyed her time at Manchester Metropolitan University because they offer a variety of assistance options. She liked the idea that if you need help with your work, there are professionals
        available to help you, as well as classes to help you develop academic writing skills. However, in recent years, campus has been inaccessible due to covid, and she has had to complete the course online as a full-time student, making her course
        and experience overall more difficult.</p>

    <h2>Jake – Business Management 6 Feb 2020</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Jake has had an enjoyable experience at Manchester Metropolitan University. It aided him to learn a lot about his course as believed the information and subject were highly useful and made him learn and develop his skills within his course. It also
        taught him a lot about himself duo to the fact that he lived alone and began meeting and working in teams with different people, which pushed him to form relationships with people.</p>

    <h2>Harry – Product Design Engineering 6 Feb 20</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Harry described his experience as comfortable since the support was easy to obtain and incredibly quick and efficient because the lecturers were constantly accessible to assist and provide feedback. As there’s a lot of the sports societies have really
        relaxed open sessions that feel comfortable for anyone to attend as well as the opportunity to compete in competitions for the universities teams. There is also a huge variety of non-sport society’s, literally something for everyone! Some of which
        are things you will have never even heard of. As The union is run by students with a genuine passion to improve student life. They are always on hand to help with information. However, University can be frustrating at time for him but ultimately,
        he feels extremely rewarded by his progress within his course and as a person</p>
